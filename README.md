# Advent of Code 2024 in Python

</div>

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024.

My plan is to get the first star each day and only go for the second if I feel like it.

## Usage

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/).

The Advent of Code input is under a restricted license and isn't in this repository. You'll need to grab the input yourself and place it, for example, under `day01/input.txt` and `day01/check.txt`.

In the root of the repository, run

`python day01/part1.py input.txt`

at your option.
